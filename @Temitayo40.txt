At the initial stage of the project, features and task were assigned to everyone,
for the frontend i was assigned to work on:

** The About Us page for the landing page:
 
   The page must be responsive [ the mobile view, tablet view and desktop view, all must respond well ]
   Actually i didn't have any issue implementing this task, it was smooth and awesome.

** The Product Page for the landing page:

   The page must be responsive [ the mobile view, tablet view and desktop view, all must respond well ]
   
    while building the mobile view, i had issue aligning the icon and the text on the same line, but i later resolved 
    this by nesting them in the same div class and imbeding the <p> tag in the icon class.

There was no issue deriving that.


2. I created the buttons so it would be easy for we designers and developers to iterate it into our work.

The issue I got at first whilst creating the buttons, is that they appeared too big for the mobile and tablet view.

I had to create the buttons into different sizes so it would be easy for the views we are creating.


3. I worked on Color Gradients

There were no challenges, cause I had to consider the colors that will be carrying out the required operations.
